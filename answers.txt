1.) The pros of Agile development versus other systems such as Waterfall development is that waterfall development is costly and requires a great deal of 
foresight meanwhile Agile development is a more flexible system that can build perhaps not a feature-complete but a useable product sooner into the 
development cycle. It also test features as they are implemented and therefore can assist in product development in finding bugs, etc.

2.) The product owner discusses with the stakeholder and determines the direction of the team meanwhile the scrum master determines how the team will be 
run in terms of JIRA tooling and daily meetings/standups.

3.) The three types of meetings are the Sprint Planning Meeting (where the team determines what to complete in the coming sprint and moves scores in the 
sprint scope from the backlog as well as determine story points), the Daily Scrum/Standup Meetings (short meetings that happen every day to gauge team 
progress and ensure employees are working on relevant projects), and the Sprint Retrospective Meeting (where the team meets at the conclusion of the sprint 
to discuss complete and uncomplete work to move material back to the backlog).

4.) Epics are large pieces of a project which can be broken down further in subtasks (which are called stories). Stories are then pieces of these large 
projects which are small enough to have an easily addressable prompt. Then, bugs are an issue which have the capacity to block other tasks such as stories 
from being completed (and therefore define an order of completion). Finally, tasks are miscellaneous... tasks... that need to be completed yet are not 
quite stories.
